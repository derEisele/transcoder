MEDIA TRANSCODER / MEDIA LIBRARY

This is a simple PYTHON / FLASK / FFMPEG / VIDEOJS based media library and on-the-fly transcoding server and frontend. It allows frontends to use the transcoder (probably even sitting on another machine). The VideoJS player object is hacked a bit to support pseudostreaming.
